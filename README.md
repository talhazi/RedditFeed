# Reddit Feed

> This web app integrates with Redditâ€™s API to show the top posts in a given subreddit.

The flow of the code is as follows:
1. The *subreddit search form* accepts *searchTerm*, *sortBy* and *searchLimit* as queries.
2. When the form identifies a `'submit'` event, it parses the search queries.
3. Then it send a `GET` request according to that queries, to fetch the recent data from Reddit API.
4. Iterate through the relevant data (subreddit's posts) and parse all as HTML code.
5. Add the results to the Main view `index.ejs` file.
